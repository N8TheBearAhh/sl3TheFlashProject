"Recreating an Automatic Plate Number Registration System (ANPR) through MATLAB"

In this project, the proponents plan on using the programming language known as MATLAB that will read and detect a plate number of a given car or motor vehicle, which consists of a combination of letters and numbers and will store it in its own personal database; thus creating an Automatic Number Plate Recognition System (ANPR). In this program, it will consist of the following features: Plate Number Detection and Removal of Background Images for clarity.
